//    Say what performaces are over or under booked

// Current work:
    // Deleting all performances for a team deletes the team. Save teams and their separately in the teams collection
//        Adding a team will create two instances of the team in the teams collection
//        None of the teams from the teams collection appear in the TeamListView
